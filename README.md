# Automatic collection and filtering of Proxy server addresses 

This project automates the collection and filtering of proxy server addresses using Python. It performs web scraping to gather proxy addresses from multiple online sources, then tests each proxy to verify its functionality and measures key metrics such as response time. The project filters out non-working or slow proxies to ensure reliability. Finally, it presents the validated proxy list along with detailed statistics like location and response time through a user friendly Flask web interface.
